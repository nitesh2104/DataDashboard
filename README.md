## Welcome to DataDashboard!

You can visit the site [DataDashboard Dashboard](https://nitesh2104.github.io/DataDashboard//) to view the official readme dashboard of the application.

DataDashboard is a user level bluetooth application that displays real time line chart graphs from the data obtained via the Bluetooth Module.
